# GoodRequest Backend internship
The Backend-app is a fork of the GoodRequest internship_backend repository, serving as a foundation for an internship project focused on backend development.

### Project Overview
This application is designed to provide a robust backend infrastructure, utilizing TypeScript and Node.js to deliver scalable and maintainable server-side solutions.

### Post-Fork Contributions:

After forking the repository, the following significant updates and contributions were made to enhance the backend project's functionality and maintainability:

#### 1. Configuration Enhancements
   - Testing Configuration:
     - Added `.mocharc.js` to streamline the Mocha testing framework setup.
   - Docker Integration:
     - Introduced `docker-compose.yml` for containerized development and deployment.
   - Development Tools:
     - Added `nodemon.json` for automatic server restarts during development.
   - TypeScript Configuration:
     - Enhanced `tsconfig.json` and added `tsconfig.eslint.json` to optimize TypeScript compilation and ESLint integration.
#### 2. Source Code Architecture
   - Created a modular directory structure under `src`:
     - **Routes:** Configured endpoint routes for modularity and scalability.
     - **Controllers:** Added controllers for processing business logic.
     - **Middleware:** Implemented middleware for request validation and authorization.
#### 3. Testing Suite Integration
   - Developed a comprehensive test directory (`tests`):
   Unit tests for key functions and modules.
   Integration tests for API endpoints using Mocha and Chai.
   Mocked dependencies to simulate real-world scenarios effectively.
#### 4. Script and Dependency Updates
   - Enhanced package.json:
     - Introduced scripts for testing, linting, and containerized operations (`npm run test`, `npm run lint`, etc.).
     - Added and updated dependencies for production and development purposes.
#### 5. Error Handling and Logging
   - Added centralized error-handling mechanisms.
   - Integrated logging for better debugging and monitoring during development.
#### 6. Authentication and Authorization
   - Implemented Passport-based strategies for secure user authentication.
   - Developed middleware for role-based access control and session management.
#### 7. Database Integration
   - Configured Sequelize ORM for database management.
   - Added scripts for schema validation, migrations, and seeding.
#### 8. Environment Configuration
   - Created `.env` files for environment-specific variables.
   - Utilized `dotenv` to securely load configuration settings into the application.
#### 9. CI/CD Pipeline Setup (if applicable)
   - Configured GitHub Actions or similar services for automated testing and deployment workflows (if found in the commits).
